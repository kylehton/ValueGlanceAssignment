## Contents

This project is one that uses the provided API endpoint to gather data. It then has various filtering and sorting methods to view specific data entries.

Data Retrieval:
    This app uses a simple fetch command to the API endpoint URL, passed with my API key. It waits for the full result to complete then moves on.

    These can be reset by the "Reset Sort/Filters" button.

Sorting:
    6 different outcomes are formulated: regarding "Date", "Revenue", and "Net Income", all of which can be sorted in "Ascending" or "Descending" order, which can be reset through the "Reset Sort/Filters" button.
